Setup your development environment
==================================

Prerequisites
-------------
We assume you are using Linux or MacOS.

  go
  docker

Start running your local instance

For developing, you might want to start a local instance of the DIA ecosystem.
Just clone our repository::

  git clone git@github.com/diadata-org/TODO

and build everything::

  docker build TODO
